# Asset Placeholders

Add your media to these folders before running src/meme_generator.py.
Each directory is ignored by Git so you can keep large binaries locally.

- udio/ – music beds for image-driven renders.
- udio_for_video/ – soundtrack options for Reddit video clips.
- ackgrounds_image/ and ackgrounds_video/ – still or motion backdrops.
- anner/, overlays/, particles/ – motion graphics overlays.
- distractions/, emoji/ – PNG stickers.
- luts/ – color look-up tables (.cube).
- models/ – drop 
sfw.299x299.h5 here to enable filtering (or use NSFW_MODEL_URL).

Each folder currently contains only a .gitkeep file so the tree stays intact. Populate them with your own assets locally.
